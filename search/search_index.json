Naturally, I again tested my luck and proposed a piece 'Sinfonia Concertante'. Due to, however, a number of reasons, I was offered to do this piece in a concert next year. During the sightreading session, Mr. Snowdon appreciated my conducting skills and suggested that I study conducting under Ms. Margarita Mikhailova</p> <p>Then the next year came - After working further on the piece over the summer, I am finally priemered the piece in Feburary 2024.  <p></p>"},{"location":"Music/music.html#royal-holloway","title":"Royal Holloway","text":""},{"location":"Music/music.html#year-1","title":"Year 1","text":"<p>In September 2024, I began my study as a Physics with Music student at Royal Holloway.
